# YouFloat - Watch YouTube videos and browse comments at the same time

Inspired by the YouTube application, I developed a chrome extension that displays YouTube videos in a floating player when you scroll down to read the comments.

# Installation
Clone or download the repository then load the unpacked extension to chrome. Instructions to do so can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).

# Known issues
- The progress bar doesn't work as expected on the floating player at the moment
- Resizing the browser can cause visual issues
